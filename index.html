				The goal of this town hall is to have a forum for Spectra membership to raise issues affecting the LGBTQ+ math community, organize and strategize for future programming and initiatives, and to provide a communal space for these increasingly hostile times.<br /><br />

The town hall will have a brief opening section to introduce the structure and format, before going into separate break out rooms for participants to discuss issues and actions that can be taken. The topics that will be discussed will be fielded from the Spectra membership. These discussions can delve into actions you would like Spectra to take, policies that we should pressure our professional societies to implement, or other issues that are facing our community.  To submit a topic for the forum, please fill out the following form by April 14th: <a href="https://forms.gle/dt4VbHg7QEeSBRyJ9">https://forms.gle/dt4VbHg7QEeSBRyJ9</a><br /><br />

There will be two events, each two hours in duration, at times that are intended to be accessible for participants across the globe. The event will be held over Zoom and the format of each event will be as follows:<br /><br />

			<ul>
				<li>15 minute introduction</li>
				<li>Two 30 minute moderated sessions in break out rooms on specific topics fielded from the membership (prior to the event)</li>
				<li>5 minute break after each breakout session</li>
				<li>30 minutes in the main Zoom room wherein breakout room scribes and facilitators will report on the main takeaways from their groupsâ€™ discussions, followed by brief closing remarks</li>
			</ul>
To run these town halls, we need volunteers to act as facilitators and scribes for each breakout room. Volunteers do not need to be present at both town hall events. If you are interested in volunteering for this event please fill out the following form by April 14th: <a href="https://forms.gle/KFUsZQBDEhNKK2UeA">https://forms.gle/KFUsZQBDEhNKK2UeA</a>
